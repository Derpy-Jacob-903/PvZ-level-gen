yes
@CurrentLevel means it's in this level's JSON
@LevelModules means it's in the levelmodules.json
 
minefulTacticianToday at 15:50
quite literally anything can be CurrentLevel, really
 
PealoverToday at 15:50
well just @. goes too i guess
 
minefulTacticianToday at 15:50
@. is a bit different
 
define before use functionToday at 15:50
Guess I am adding an option to let people choose whether they want CurrentLevel or LevelModules
 
minefulTacticianToday at 15:50
gonna be extra code for you
some things are strictly Cur, some are optional
 
PealoverToday at 15:51
some of the modules refer to currentlevel because they don't exist in levelmodules
 
minefulTacticianToday at 15:51
@. is at current rton
@CurrentLevel is at current level
 
PealoverToday at 15:52
what's the difference
 
minefulTacticianToday at 15:52
when the rton is not a level
 
PealoverToday at 15:52
so it won't work if you use currentlevel in levelmodules?
 
minefulTacticianToday at 15:52
yes
for example
in zombietypes I code dino
dino@. means if I call him as dino@ZombieTypes in a level, the game will search for its props in zombietypes
dino@CurrentLevel means if I call him, the game will search for its props in THAT level.
