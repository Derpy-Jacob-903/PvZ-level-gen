Planned:
1. Interactive grid UI (probably table?)
2. Import JSON for user edit (choose world to display plants and zombies according to that world)
3. A level parser (well HTML's security... this should be for Internet Explorer only.)
4. Logger
5. Responsive style
6. (IMPORTANT) Highlight essential parts of JSON
7. Names for alias

Changelog:
v0.1 -> 0.5: Bug fixes (also more bugs to fix)
